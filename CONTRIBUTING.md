# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

## Our Approach

Hello! I'm Alan, the creator and maintainer of this project.

To be transparent: This project has a focused scope and modest goals. It's designed to be a daily math game, similar to Wordle but with equations. While I appreciate community interest, I'm currently not looking for extensive contributions or major changes.

The project aims to:

1. Provide a fun, daily math challenge
2. Maintain simplicity and ease of use
3. Stay functional and up-to-date

If you encounter bugs, please open an issue with a detailed description and steps to reproduce. A CodeSandbox demonstrating the issue is greatly appreciated.

For enhancement ideas, feel free to share via an issue, but please understand that responses may not be immediate.

If you're considering a pull request, please note that I'll be selective about accepting contributions. Your PR might not receive immediate attention due to time constraints.

This project is MIT-licensed, which means you're free to fork and modify it for your own use. Feel free to build upon it, but please don't expect all changes to be merged, especially without prior discussion.

## Bug Reports

If you encounter a problem with this project, please open an issue including:

- Project version
- Browser and operating system
- Clear, concise description of the issue
- Link to a CodeSandbox (or similar) demonstrating the problem (optional, but highly recommended, especially for complex problems)

I can't promise that I'll respond to all opened issues. I'm focused right now on launching my own business.
